# Dolphin (Gamecube Emulator)

This page contains all the details of my personal gaming setup for the Dolphin emulator on macOS (Linux is fairly similar using `apt`, `apk` etc).

## Installing Dolphin

Grab the latest build from `brew`:

```
brew install dolphin
```

That's it!


## Custom HD Textures

1. Check both `Load Custom Textures` and `Prefetch Custom Textures` in the main **Graphics** settings
2. Open `File` > `Open User Folder`
3. Navigate to `Load` > `Textures`
4. Create a new folder named after your game code (ie, RE2 is `GHAE08`)
5. Dump all texture files into this newly created folder
6. Enjoy HD textures!
