title: Switching Things Over to ikiwiki
---

I've done it again. My personal website is no longer generated with [barf](https://barf.bt.ht) but is instead built on top of [[ikiwiki]]. The old RSS feed ([bt.ht/atom.xml](https://bt.ht/atom.xml)) still exists but will no longer receive updates. The new feed can be found on the bottom of the homepage ([index.rss](/index.rss))

## Why a Wiki?

I love the simplicity of a minimal blog, which is why I always gravitated towards purely "static" site builders. Over time though, I found two minor issues that slowly chipped away at me: ease-of-use and flexibility.

I had a vision, back when I began tinkering with my own place on the web, of building out my own personal "resource center" or wiki. Often times through work or personal projects I stumble into little problems that I need to solve. Most times I find a solution and move on with my life. The problem with this approach is *lack of documentation*.

What if I come across that issue at a later point in time? Will I even remember my old solution? Probably not. So, I've made the switch to a more flexible, personal wiki (which also happens to be a blog!)

## Text Editors, Terminals, and Web UI - Oh My!

[[ikiwiki]] comes packed with multiple ways to publish pages and posts. Since it is built with [[ikiwiki/git]] version control in mind, you have the ability to push out changes directly to your server similar to that of pre-existing static site generators. It also gives you the choice to `ssh` directly into your server and publish content from your terminal if you so desire.

Best of all, [[ikiwiki]] offers a web UI interface. This is something I have long missed since leaving "dynamic" websites behind.

## But Wait, There's More!

Did I mention that this site now supports a built-in search form *and* a comment system? I've been wanting comments or discussions directly on my personal web space for the longest time and now I do! The search function is really an added bonus, mostly for my own personal use to find something I documented quickly.

## Broken Links and Bugs

I've done my best to properly forward all original posts and pages to their new URLs - but I'm sure some things will be overlooked. So please feel free to reach out and let me know if anything seems broken.

I look forward to growing out this "platform" and seeing how it impacts my workflow writing documentation / blog posts. I hope you'll come along for the ride!
