# CSS Video Backgrounds

2018-04-16

With the release of Safari 11.1 on macOS and Safari on iOS 11.3, developers now have the ability to support background videos (mp4 support only - at the time of this article) with pure CSS.

Example:


	.video-background {
		background-image: url('path-to-video.mp4);
	}


## See it in action

Check out the very basic CodePen I created below to see it live (make sure you view it in latest Safari or else you won't see anything :P)
