Hi, my name is Bradley Taunt. I'm a designer/developer hybrid helping software companies improve their user experience and ship more performant products. Currently making search engine results data more accessible at [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com). 

But you probably read all that on my homepage. Interested to learn more?

## I am...

* Married to a wonderful wife (she also happens to be my best friend)
* Raising 3 awesome kids (aged 6, 4 and 2) with said wife
* Living in rural Canada (I can see cows and horses outside my window!)
* Passionate about open source software / hardware
* A huge hockey fan - Go Sens Go!
* An avid gamer (whenever I get a chance), specifically the "soulsborne" type genre
* A collector of vintage computers and electronics
