# Designer, developer, hardware tinkerer, open source advocate, consumer of dark roast coffee, and writer of very long sentences.

Hi, my name is Bradley Taunt. I'm a designer/developer hybrid helping software companies improve their user experience and ship more performant products.

I also actively maintain several [open source projects](/projects).

I'm passionate about open source software, usability, performance, privacy, and minimal design. This small piece of the internet stores a growing collection of my personal [brain dumps](/posts/dump).

### Skills & Languages

Core programming languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. For design work, my preferred tools are Sketch, GIMP, and Figma. I also enjoy tinkering with basic shell scripts and [Unix systems](/public/images/unix.gif).
