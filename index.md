**Designer, developer, hardware tinkerer, open source advocate, consumer of dark roast coffee, and writer of very long sentences.**

As a designer/developer hybrid, I help software companies improve their user experience and ship more performant products. I also actively maintain several [open source projects](/projects).

I'm passionate about open source software, usability, performance, privacy, and minimal design. This small piece of the internet stores a growing collection of my personal [brain dumps](/posts/dump).

## Skills & Languages

Core tools are HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript & WordPress. Currently improving my skills with Rails, MongoDB & PHP. I also enjoy tinkering with basic shell scripts and [Unix systems](/public/images/unix.gif).
