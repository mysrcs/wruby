# Pizza

This page showcases the *official* Pizza Fund (Donations). Here I list and celebrate those kind enough to donate pizza(s) into my stomach. Pizza fuels my creativity and helps me publish helpful articles and develop new open source projects.

If you feel the burning desire to donate to the *pizza fund* in order to support this small blog of mine or any number of my [[projects]], please take a look at the options below. You can still enjoy everything on this blog for free, so please don't feel obligated to donate.

## How are donations used?

That's a good question. Almost all money donated goes towards hosting, domain renewal costs and open source services I use myself. Anything "extra" ends up getting me pizza to enjoy while I publish more free (and hopefully useful) content/projects.

### Say Hello

If you don't have the means to donate but still want to "help" in some way, simply [shoot me an email](mailto:bt@btxx.org). Talk a little about yourself and say hello. A friendly conversation is worth just as much as a pizza (well, almost!).

This page is greatly influenced by Bryan's [wall of pizza](https://brynet.ca/wallofpizza.html) (be sure to buy him some pizza if you enjoy his work!)
