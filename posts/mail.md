# Working with `git` Patches in Apple Mail

2023-05-11

> **Before we begin**: You could likely automate this process in a more streamlined way, but for most use cases this workflow should be fine.

I recently covered how to [work with git email patches in Evolution on Linux](/git-patches), so I thought it would make sense to walk through a similar workflow for those using Apple Mail on MacOS. The idea is essentially the same, with just a little extra work involved.

## Create a "Patches" Mailbox

The first thing you'll need to do is make a new `Patches` mailbox folder inside your existing mail account. Once done, your default Mail sidebar should look similar to the following:

![The Apple Mail sidebar with the Patches folder present](/public/images/apple-mail-1.png)

*The Apple Mail sidebar with the "Patches" folder present*

## Applying Patches

Now navigate to the email message containing a `git` patch. Right-click and select *Move to* > *Patches*. Now in the sidebar, right-click your *Patches* folder and select *Export Mailbox...*. You'll be prompted to save this folder locally. I suggest having a top-level folder named **Patches** to make things consistent.

Inside this folder you should see something similar to the following structure:

![The contents of the saved Patches mailbox folder](/public/images/apple-mail-2.png)

*The contents of the saved Patches mailbox folder*

Once saved, open your terminal, navigate to the project you wish to apply this new patch to:

```sh
cd my-path/very-cool-project
```

and then run:

```sh
git apply ~/Patches/<saved-patches-mailbox-folder>/mbox
```

Congrats! You've successfully applied a git email patch through Apple Mail! Well, kind of. The terminal did most of the *real* work. Just be sure to periodically *purge* your local *Patches* folder to keep things clean!
