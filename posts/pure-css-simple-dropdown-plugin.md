# Pure CSS Simple Dropdown Plugin

2018-09-20

I find myself blowing away default browser `select` styling and implementing my own custom dropdowns far more often than I'd like. So, I recently created a very simple and clean component using just pure CSS.

Check out the CodePen below and feel free to morph it as you see fit for your own projects!
