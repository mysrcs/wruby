This page contains a somewhat up-to-date listing of all hardware and software that I currently use. Seeing similar pages on other people's personal websites have proved quite valuable to me, so I figured I would do the same!

## Services

I'm proud to support open source products and privacy-respecting communities. The list is limited right now, but the plan is to expand this over time. All prices are in CDN.
